first connecting to others computer through wifi
first getting ip of the similiar connected wifi and then doing ping (wifi ip of the reciever) (maybe wifi will  connect)
it is important to know the ip of reciever and not the sender
code in sender.py
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
services to acess others computer 
ssh(secure shell) , rdb, telnet
difference between telnet and ssh
if we have 2 system ( connecting 2 system forms a session)
the way the info goess in the session(if data is in plain text than easily accessible (telnet) in ssh encryption techniques are used they made some hash)
types of encryption rsa amd dsa
ssh used rsa 
to install package openssh-server
the service is called sshd where d is daemon ( to run a service there is a process called daemon
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl enable sshd
systemctl status sshd
rpm -qc openssh(to check configration file)
cd /etc/ssh
vim sshd_config 
go to authentucation to lower to permitrootlogin ( if commented than we would not be able to access root
ssh root@ipadressofremotemachine(eg 192.168.10.100)
if you want to make a key in ssh - 
ssh-keygen
(to send it to remote machine it will ask for a password one time and after that you don't have to add password)ssh-copy-id 192.168.10.100
task to key make and send and why it is not accessing
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
simple storage service(S3)
object storage(unstructured data) and block storage(structured data)
s3 service is globally available (data is stored in a bucket, so first you create bucket)
bucket name should be unique it allocated dynamically 5 gb free storage , allocated acc to name, name is there as it is globally )
globally we can access it but the region is given to tell in which region it is going to be made)
block public access( to restrict the bucket to be used publically)
versioning(making new version of codes and able to go to previous version so if we make a mistake we can revert back to our previous code
s3 is object storage where unstructured data is stored and static data is stored in unstructured data as dynamic requires sche,a whcich is not in unstructured data
