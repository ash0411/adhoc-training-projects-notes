difference between for and while 
	in while if the condition  is empty then it will not run but for it will be infininte loop 
	for was never a loop it was just doing something in some iteration .
if you give a line to for than it will take each line as one iteration .
but as it can think that file.txt is a file so if you want to recognise file.txt as a file 
					echo "my time is `date`"(`` to recognise it as a program)
					for i in `cat file.txt ` do echo $i done
