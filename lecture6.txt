rpm -q (for configration in redhat)
linux has default python 2.7 because it is for os  in linux
yam installs package as well as all the dependencies in it 
all the info is in rpm
yum install httpd( package of apache server)
without repo file get/yum will not be created
baseurl is the url where get will go and take the package
every package has a key which tells a package is harmful or not (gpgkey)
yum repolist(to read all repo present in your system)
yum clean all(to clean caches )
yam reinstall( to reinstall a package)
yum provides( if you know the command and you don't know from which package it came)
in ubuntu we don't have to make repo 
this difference is because redhat is enterprise version because in company we can't install the whole package  because if we install the whole package because it may have a command like rm -f which may blow up the whole server





if apache server connects mainly 2 things happen - 1. user:- the user takes the request to the apache page . if we put access control(acl) over apache user than side will stop functioning as apache user has lost read access.


serveradmin is the host
the directory tells any other user has no access to httpd they only have the access of reading the file
the documentrootis the path where we put the file(  if the index.html is not in file path than it will not run)
read the configration file
directory index gives the default page
if you update something in apache than you have to restart apache file (written in copy)
if you want to host 2 siter in apache (virtual hosting)
go to configration file
below IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf
< VirtualHost *:80>
Documentroot /var/www/html/web1/
servername www.xyx.com 
</VirtaulHost>

after this

mkdir /var/www/server
vim /var/www/server/index.html
in the file
hi every one this is a webpage

after this systemctl restart httpd

vim etc/hosts (here we are defining our own host as we have not urchased the dns)
yourpublicip www.adhoc.com
vim /etc/hosts
(enter your ip and domain name)
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
for our own yo can write curl www.adhoc.com
eg go daddy gave domain name and it didn't give ip but domain name and hosted 1000 of sites in it
vim etc/hosts
3.133.106.53 www.xyz.com ( it tells the server to go from which domain name to with ip file
(not working check why not working)
load balancer( to not let the site down)
in aws called edb
whatever instances are in load balancer it checks there health , if healthy it sends otherwise it asks the user to wait
autoscale is also used ( here if the request are less than there it sends to 1 instance else it sends to the other instance
dos attack (in this we send a lot of request to a particular site to get it down
router 53 ( domain redirection)(if there is a request here it redirects it to another ip) 
task 2-3 virtual hosting
//////////////////////////////////////////
history( in phone)
note :- as public ip change everytime you restart the instance you have to change the enteries of public ip
