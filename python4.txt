SCM 
 we have git which is distributed version control system 
 all other source code management system are centralised .
 distributed means you can take the repo and can manage according to your conviniance .
when multiple developer code according to their own compability and can contrivute it from their own compability
a version control initaited by a person but anybody can clone that 
but if i like voth the code and there is conflict in both the ideas and there can be conflict . so you can make another branches and merge them 
there are 2 parts server and client 
we are client and the place where a repository is hosted is called a hub/server.
the process we can do from hub is 1. clone 2. to make both the data equivalent we can use pull/ fetch it will compare the code of both the pc and pull it from the pc. 
clone gives the code along with history .if you have more data you can push and if the hub has more data  we can pull.
there are 2 things you can work for yourself or you can contribute
eg . you want to contribute to docker. so you can clone any of their repo after analysis. 
first you will clone their repo . 
2. case to create your own repo . 
if you want to add you can just do git add . git commit -m "" git push 
git status will tell the changges you have untracked file will tell the file that git is not aware of .
to push a particular file you can just do git add filename
commit will save the changes pemanently .
