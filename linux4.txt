the default output given in a command is called standard input
eg date command gives the date if it gives something else it is not standard output
io redirection :- if in linux you want to redirect a standard output to a file than the command is  date >a.txt
it first find its directory and checks for the file otherwise it creates the file and stores it
but whenever we run it overwrites so to make append we write date >>a.txt
if we write a call >>a.txt in terminal it will generate an error which will show in terminal and not store in the file
$? exit code
if you want to redirect error in a file  datiii 2>>a.txt
datiii &>>a.txt
if we write a command which has no output ie cat >> a.txt than it will send a null value in its place 
here we didn't get an exit code because we didn't give an argument
pipelining eg cat b.txt|date >>b.txt it first runs cat b.txt and then date >>b.txt
cat a.txt | grep -i hello (i is for input for grep )it will highlight the hello in the file a.txt
archives :- to keep a content(which is not used now but could be used in the near future) in a place that is not in our immediate need.
exchange server is the main server for microsoft 
yes command gives the repeated output string or y
wc to find the number of characters
head command shows 10 lines from begning
tail command shows 10 lines from end 
task to show 5 to 15 lines of a  file   head a.txt [5:15]
compress means to make a content small ( it stores the meta data of the file and stores its size)
.tar file  extension for compressed file 
here we have gzip as compared to windows zip
if we want to compress a.txt than (tar -cvzf new.gzip.tar a.txt)-c for create -v for verbose  -z for gzip -f for file name
To extract a tar file (tar -xvf new.gzip.tar)
to extract just one file of the 2 in the tar file(task)
tar file doesn't effect when we remove -
in cd .. (every folder has a . and .. than when cd runs it goes the directory of ..)
every user level command is put in /bin and in /sbin there are administrator level commands
