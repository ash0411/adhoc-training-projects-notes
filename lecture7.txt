													how to set path in windows
you can also use windows powershell (some commands of linux also work here)
go to my computer properties and advance system settings and there set enviornment variables
go to user/path and there add a path(you can also try to restart 
in python3 there is scripts and there it is pip so set the path of both python3 and pip

aws 
													PARTITIONS
partitions has a limit which depends on tables
there are 2 gpt(guid partition table)(windows)(128 partitions) and mbr/dos(linux/unix)(master board record)(4 where all 4 partitions are primary)(can get 60 logical partitions(extended))- in this 3 primary and 1 extended)
hdd consists of sectors and 1 sector has sizeof 512 bytes. 
hdd -> aws
fdisk -l(to show details of storage)  
fdisk .dev.xvda
make the 3 partitions and give the rest of the space to the 4 extended partitions
partitions are made with null type point value

 
why do we format 
it makes a new index  for the folder and if you have not put new data into the folder than you can recover the data
windows uses ntfs and redhat uses xfs to format .
fat has architecture of not transferring more than 4 gb so it can't transfer file more than 4 gb
from null the harddisk gets file system so as you have made partition you have to first format 
mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdb(for format)(/dev has all the drives)
double tab gives possiblities and aws can't use it because aws doesn;t have base completion
xvdb file is linked to a directory and this process is called mounting process(hdw -os ke beech link )
mount xvdv19 ( /mnt temporary and /mount permanent)
df ( for seeing linking)
df -h (for humans)
mount /dev/xvdb1/disk1/
df -h( to check)
mkdir /disk1/hii(this will make the file in disk1 which will make the directory getting saved in xvdb1
mounting is basically a linking process which links from 1 place to another which is gone while reboot
to permanently mount store the data in etc/fstab and this file should be in /etc
but for storing you need uuid( it is standard) so use
lsblk --output=uuid /dev/xvdb1( to get uuid which is only created when the file is formated)
vim /etc/fstb
uuid = ___________/disk1         xfs        defaults            0 0
mount -a(to check if we have correctly done it)
df
extended partition is not formated because it will be used for making new sectors or it can be said partitions)

lvm ----------------------
logical volume - lvm is tech to manage harddisk 9 it is inside device mapper
yum provide pvcreate
yum install lvm2
pvcreate /dev/xvdb2 /dev/xvdb3 /dev/xvdb5( first creating physical volume)
vgcreate vgroup /dev/xvdb2 /dev/xvdb3 /dev/xvdb5 ( for merging them into a new group)
vgdisplay(to check the info regarding group)
lvcreate --name adhoc --size 1G vgroup 
lvdisplay /dev/vgroup/adhoc
vgdisplay vgroup
mkfs /dev/vgroup/adhco /kk
and then mount
check how to retrieve data if a hard disk fails
blkid ( it gives uuid of all)
