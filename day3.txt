Starting with linux class
for windows developer mode 
control panel/programs/programs and features
windows feature on/off go down and open hyper -V , virtual machine platform and windows hoperviser platform
then apply
and then restart
then go to settings search for developers and switch on developer mode(it will search packages related to developer mode and automatically install them.
 I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored I am bored .
 go to microsoft store and install ubuntu
 search a package named putty and install it.(MSI is windows installer.)
 so when you run virtual  machine you run putty and give ip of virtual machine and the command for ip is ipconfig in windows and ifconfig in linux.
machine/settings/network and change mat to host only adopter and restart wired connection( at battery).
for my machine 
ping to a server(ie write the server ip address
than write ssh root@192.168.10.236
yes and then  type the password 
pinky se check how many are connected
//windows 10 has ssh command in terminal 
today we have a new directory sturcture called 
cat /etc/os-release(concatinate files and give their information regarding system)
					SHELL
everything we type in os is executed by kernel and kernel supports binary language . so the program b/w kernel and user called interpreter, but this is exactly shell. In different os we have different shell mac has sh shell, microsoft uses power shell, redhat is configured with bash.powershell is not oss execpt that you will be able to use every shell. 
how to check shell :- bash language is bash . 
					strace date ( it traces the system call) 
so our focus is bash which is a interpreter .
echo $x (to print a variable x)
for simple printing text you can just use echo x ie to print x
echo $SHELL to print current shell this is a variable by system
whoami goes to $USER variable to get the user
$LANG ( it gives the current terminal language)
the program called env it gives all variable given by you and the system by the current shell.
if we give a value to kernel which is not in the system for a long time it leads to kernel panic so the shell first check what the user has given and tells the user whether the shell has it or not. but as the hardisk is very long so we give kernel a path which tells the kernel from where you have to check from . 
mv /usr/bin/date /etc ( it moves usr/bin/date to /etc)
to set path variable
PATH=$PATH:/root/Desktop (to add temporary)(here appending the path)(dont give gaps in between =)
ls -a (to see hidden file)
useradd user ( to add user)
su - ash( to switch user)
to make permanent user write the path statement in .bashrc under user specific aliases and functions
if you want to use alias 
alias ct = 'date +%T' (then if we type ct we can execute the command )(if we push in bashrc it becomes permanent)
alias command to check list of commands both by users and you
to remove alias you can just type unalias ct .
shell scripting 
it just means to write what we are doing to write in a file and run it .

.sh is also is not important in linux
#!/bin/bash
date
echo $PATH
pwd 
whoami
then write in cmd
chmod +x day3.sh
./day3.sh


USER MANAGEMENT IN LINUX
in linux we can search user or in cmd we first have to have root access then useradd aashish 
passwd aashish
(to give user name and password)
user del -r ash(to delete a user)(-r to remove all the work of the user)
if you want to repeat command from history 
!900(this will repeat 900 command from history)
